BE carefull 
when you try pushing your project to github 
ensure that you write your commands inside the folder of your project (the 
directory where your project is located in this case    store>..)
then ensure that inside you project folder their is not .git folder because 
it will ruin everything . only one .git folder must be inside your project_name 
folder next to frontend and backend folders) 

then do those commands:
cd C:\path\to\your\project
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY>.git
git push -u origin master  # or git push -u origin main   


<USERNAME>  ayedi-cyber  (ism compte te3ak)
/<REPOSITORY>  BlogProductStore-Express-level4- (ism repository)

be carefull here if you use those instructions then you put master and not main 
if you use github instruction then you can put main
